# Movie Collection

This web app allows users to view, add to as well as remove from a collection of movies.

## Description

We were tasked with a project using python and flask to create a web app to display a collection of items (of our choosing).
I opted to go with a collection of movies that I could display as well as add too and even remove.

The starting point is the "home" page. Here the user can navigate via the navbar at the top of the page. I have also added a link to the center "Now Playing" image that when clicked,
will bring the user to the "collections" page. Clicking the "Add Movie" link in the nav bar will bring the user to the "Add Movie" page where they can provide their image file,
as well as other information required. When they hit the "Add Movie" button the page will redirect to the "View Collection" page where they can view the newest addition.
If they click on the "Remove Movie" link in the navbar, they are redirected to the "remove movie" page where they enter the title of the movie they would like to delete and hit the "Remove Movie" button.

There is also a Login, Logout and Create Account feature as well that communicates with a "users" table in the database.

### Installing

All that is required to operate are my files which can be found [here](https://github.com/Lawrence-Downey/flask-project).
